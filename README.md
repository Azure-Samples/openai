# Azure AI Foundry, Agents, and Azure OpenAI Service Samples

This repository provides practical resources and code samples for building solutions with [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service/), [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry), and advanced agent-based architectures. These samples help accelerate your adoption of Azure's latest AI capabilities for language, vision, and agentic workflows.

## 🚀 Get Started

### Prerequisites

- **Azure Account** - If you're new to Azure, get an Azure account for [free](https://aka.ms/free) and you'll get some free Azure credits to get started.
- **Azure OpenAI Service Access** - For more details, see the [Azure OpenAI Service documentation on how to get access](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview#how-do-i-get-access-to-azure-openai).
- **Azure AI Foundry Resource** - For agent-based solutions, you'll need access to Azure AI Foundry. See the [Azure AI Foundry documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/azure-ai-foundry/) for setup details.
- **Model Deployments** - Deploy models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, DALL-E, and Whisper. See the documentation for [deploying models](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) and [model availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models).

### Project Setup

Each solution folder contains detailed setup and installation instructions. Follow the instructions provided with these solutions to get going.

## 📂 Solutions

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTE** ⚠️
> Starter templates, instructions, code samples and resources under Agent_Based_Samples are designed to assist in accelerating development of agents for specific scenarios. It is important that you review all provided resources and carefully test Agent behavior in the context of your use case: Learn more: [AI Foundry Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview).
Certain Agent offerings may be subject to legal and regulatory requirements, may require licenses, or may not be suitable for all industries, scenarios, or use cases. By using any sample, you are acknowledging that Agents or other output created using that sample are solely your responsibility, and that you will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and relevant safety standards, terms of service, and codes of conduct.
