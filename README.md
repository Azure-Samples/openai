# Azure AI Foundry, Agents, and Azure OpenAI Service Samples

This repository provides practical resources and code samples for building solutions with [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service/), [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/azure-ai-foundry/), and advanced agent-based architectures. These samples help accelerate your adoption of Azure's latest AI capabilities for language, vision, and agentic workflows.

## üöÄ Get Started

### Prerequisites

- **Azure Account** - If you're new to Azure, get an Azure account for [free](https://aka.ms/free) and you'll get some free Azure credits to get started.
- **Azure OpenAI Service Access** - For more details, see the [Azure OpenAI Service documentation on how to get access](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview#how-do-i-get-access-to-azure-openai).
- **Azure AI Foundry Resource** - For agent-based solutions, you'll need access to Azure AI Foundry. See the [Azure AI Foundry documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/azure-ai-foundry/) for setup details.
- **Model Deployments** - Deploy models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, DALL-E, and Whisper. See the documentation for [deploying models](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) and [model availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models).
