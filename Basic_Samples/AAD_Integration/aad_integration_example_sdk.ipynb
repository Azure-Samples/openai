    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use the Azure OpenAI (AOAI) Service API with the [OpenAI Python SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-python).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup for Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication.\n",
    "    * See [Setup to use AAD and test with CLI](setup_aad.md).\n",
    "2. A Python environment setup with all the requirements.  \n",
    "    * See the [setup_python_env.md](setup_python_env.md) page for instructions on setting up your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuring OpenAI SDK\n",
    "The OpenAI SDK can be configured via _config_ file.  \n",
    "\n",
    " | SDK Variable | Description |\n",
    " | -- | -- |\n",
    " | `api_type` | API Type.  Use `azure_ad` for AAD authentication.  |\n",
    " | `api_version` | API Version.  You can use `2022-12-01`. |\n",
    " | `api_base` | Base URL for the API.  This is the endpoint URL for your team. |\n",
