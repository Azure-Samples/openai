They must work for Nutiva or have a friend who does.<br />This stuff is super healthy, I'm sure - but tastes friggin' awful. It's like cardboard pulp. I make smoothies with it which my mom said look like diarrhea.<br /><br />I'm stuck with this huge 3 lb bag - which, in its defense - is a fantastic bargain. But I got it in 2010 and I'm still trying to choke it down two years later. Spend the extra money and get yourself some Vega. It's certainly pricier, but you get what you pay for.\r\n",

Black tea has a strong flavor so the vanilla doesn't stand out as much and also natural unsweetened vanilla tastes a lot different than commercial vanilla products or artificial vanilla.<br /><br />I'm guessing a lot of people are used to artificial vanilla since it's a lot sweeter. The difference between real vanilla and artificial vanilla is like the difference between a watermelon and watermelon flavor.<br /><br />I do have one complaint though, the tea leaves smell like maple syrup and vanilla. Kind of weird, but it tastes good.\r\n",

I use them on my cereal, yogurt, granola and even in baking. They are yummy and very good for you. I shared one bag with my two health conscious kids and put the other bag in the freezer so I can dip into as needed.  You will not regret buying these.

I drink decaf coffee, and it's often difficult to find decaf in different variaties.  When I found these pods from Baronet, I decided to take a chance on them.  They are so much better than the ones from Senseo!  The flavor is rich and the price is quite a bit less than the old pods I was buying. The Baronet pods are also stronger in flavor, which is great if you want to make a larger mug of coffee.  They come in flavors, too!  Highly recommend!!\r\n",
