You can definitely make out both the blackberry and vanilla, and they blend very nicely.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it isn't unpleasant.  I made it hot, but didn't finish it and the air conditioning was on, so it got cold.  It was quite cold when I tried it for the second time, and it tasted great!  This is the type of tea I like drinking in the afternoon; I won't be switching my morning Lady Grey tea for this.<br /><br />I love the tea bag design.  With the pyramid tea bag I can see what the tea is, rather than look through an opaque square tea bag.  The tea tasted very fresh, too.\r\n",

Please, whatever you do, don't get this particular package, because you will be horribly disappointed, unless you want the K-cups no one else would want or drink!! Yes, they are all different, but out of the 35 there I will only be drinking maybe 10 of them, the rest I will try to give away although I doubt anyone will want them!! Alot are decaf, which I don't drink, or they are tea or hot chocolate. I was hoping for actual flavored coffee, now I know to only order my K-cups from Keurig or I will buy them at the store!! I am sadly disappointed in this assortment of K-cups, and the person that packed my bag really did a HORRIBLE job!! Oh, and 4 of them are either empty, or the coffee in them is hard and stale!!\r\n",

One day we asked the owner what they use to brew it with and he told us Calypso by Mighty Leaf. He even gave us a sample bag to take home with us. Anyways, we have been ordering it ever since and love it. If you are an ice tea lover, this is the best you can use. It has this subtle kind of passion fruit like after taste.. which compliments every time you take a sip and exhale.\r\n",

       "4, Worth the money, but nothing to write home about.: First of all, shipping and packaging went very well. I'm impressed in that regard. After reading the previous review, I was kind of expecting to be blown away by the wonderful smell and taste. I'm not saying it tastes or smells bad, but it's not as amazing as the other reviewer puts it. The fragrance and taste is hard to describe, but good. I brewed it at a relatively hot temperature for about 6 minutes, and added sugar with it. The tea tastes fruity but with a cinnamon kick to it as well as floral undertones. I would recommend this product to another person, but I don't think I'll be able to use all 16oz of it. Buying a smaller bag might be a good idea.\r\n",

While I think most of us love hot, buttered popcorn with an ample amount of salt the simple fact is it's not very healthy.  So, I was on a search to find something which was flavorful on air-popped popcorn, but not too bad nutritionally.  This fits the bill.\r\n"

This was a powdered product which was tasteless I can only assume it is another Chinese knock off.  Don't bother spending money for it.\r\n",

So you can spend exorbitant amounts of money at the grocery store for more vanilla beans than you need, or you can order the amount you need with free shipping. Each bean was in its own plastic vacuum package that looked like it could keep for awhile if you needed it to. The cake was, of course, delicious, and my trash smelled great from the two little plastic vanilla bean packages, so maybe you could use them to make something else smell nice.\r\n",

But I definitely did not think that the flavor was particularly French Vanilla, even with French Vanilla creamer.  It felt \"heavy\" on my tongue and had a \"dark\" coffee flavor which I believe overcame the French Vanilla flavor.  I was very disappointed that I had paid so much for so little flavor. Additionally, when I tried to return the products, the site informed me tht they ewere not returnable (Even the unopened packages).\r\n",
