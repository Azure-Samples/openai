I have found that microwaving makes reguar bread rubbery but not so the low carb buns (same for their hot dog buns) while the usual warming makes them dry.

Six boxes in three months maybe a bit more than I need as I am told to cut back/eliminate.  But these are a great way to get my chocolate fix.  Only the CHOC FUDGE is carried by our stores, but the MILK CHOC is what I prefer.<br /><br />On a similar note, why do stores limit their sugar free inventory?

In addition, one of our Aussies needs daily thyroid pills.  We found Pill Pockets is the very best way to do this.  Opening the mouth wide and trying to put the pill waaay in the back of the mouth before clamping the jaws shut and massaging the throat until the poor dog swallows is a bad thing to do to a beloved pet.  It's bad because Pill Pockets make this chore a happy and delicious time for the dog involved.  The Pockets (in the pet store we use) come in chicken or beef flavors, so we alternate flavors every time we buy a new supply.

Another great way to make it even better is try adding fresh Mango while it is simmering or if you cant find it fresh, use canned mango nectar, substitute 1/4 cup of the water for the mango juice. Super Good!. Also instead of 2 1/2 cups water as suggested  use only 2 1/4 cups water, brings out the flavor a little bit more I think (2 cups water / 1/4 cup mango nectar).\",5,positive,positive,0.8611612\r\n",

The tins are recyclable in most locations.  The individually wrapped candies are made with cane sugar and real ginger, no high fructose corn syrup so they are in a way better for you than other candy options.  Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and can settle a stomach and ease hearburn.  When's the last time your chocolate bar did that?\",4,positive,negative,0.8807133\r\n",

Most meals like this taste more like an upgraded cup of noodles, where this is a nice meal in a crunch. Now I will say you really need to read the instructions before cooking. The opening instructions can be assumed and cause the sauce to go flying when the food is done cooking. With that in mind, it's not ideal for kids to cook on their own. The film was rather tight and I can see a child or pre-teen getting burned if they are not paying attention while the open the contents. With that, please be careful.

I usually add a little more milk than instructed to cut down on the spice and add a little more creaminess.  The thing I really like about this chai mix is that it's not sweet at all.

       "B0076YVPFC,Handy,\"Love the idea of ready in a minute pasta and for that alone this product gets praise.  The pasta is whole grain so that's a big plus and it actually comes out al dente.  The vegetable marinara sauce is tasty, but has a high salt content - 710mg for a 9 oz. serving.<br /><br />It looks like much thought and testing went into creating the packaging, but I found it challenging.  You need to pull back the film to expose the sauce tray -- and not spill it.  I had to pull hard on the film, which made the sauce cup wiggle.  Easy to work around, but tricky nonetheless.<br /><br />All in all a step up from usual microwave in a minute fare.\",3,negative,positive,0.88317287\r\n",

The cereal, like I remember it, is very good and my boyfriend agrees that it is the best cereal he has ever had, but sadly after 5 months of searching I wont be ordering this cereal again.

Instead, I now buy Purina Chewnola bones - they entertain my little guy for hours and he keeps going back to it until it's gone.  I recommend this to anyone with a dog who's into chewing.  I also recommend you buy them on Amazon since you can pay as much as 50% less than you pay at a store.

I think they are a bit sweeter than regular Cadbury milk chocolate bars(but those are already pretty sweet too, so am not sure), and even though I like the texture, it's not worth it to pay so much for them.
