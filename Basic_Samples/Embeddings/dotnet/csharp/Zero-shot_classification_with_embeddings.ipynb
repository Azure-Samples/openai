    "## Zero-Shot Classification\n",
    "To perform zero shot classification, we want to predict labels for our samples without any training. To do this, we can simply embed short descriptions of each label, such as positive and negative, and then compare the cosine distance between embeddings of samples and label descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest similarity label to the sample input is the predicted label. We can also define a prediction score to be the difference between the cosine distance to the positive and to the negative label. This score can be used for plotting a precision-recall curve, which can be used to select a different tradeoff between precision and recall, by selecting a different threshold."

    "The code defines two public records, `Label` and `LabelledItem`. The `Label` record represents a label with its associated text and embedding. The `LabelledItem` record represents an item with its associated product ID, summary, text, score, label, predicted label, and probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PredictLabels` method is used to predict labels for a given set of data. It takes three parameters: `positiveLabel` and `negativeLabel` which are strings representing the labels for positive and negative sentiments, and `data` which is an enumerable collection of `DataRow` objects representing the data to be classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the method, a list of `Label` objects is created. Then, the method calculates the average embedding for each label. It does this by filtering the `data` based on the `Score` property, then aggregating the `Embedding` property of each item. This is done separately for positive and negative scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "After calculating the average embeddings, the method creates new `Label` objects with the calculated embeddings and adds them to the `labels` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the method creates a list of `LabelledItem` objects by iterating over the `data`. For each item in `data`, it calculates the similarity score with each label in the `labels` list, selects the label with the highest score, and creates a new `LabelledItem` with this information. The list of `LabelledItem` objects is then returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of improvements, the code is quite efficient and readable as it is. However, you might consider adding comments or extracting some of the logic into separate methods to improve readability further. For example, the logic for calculating the average embeddings could be extracted into a separate method."

I have found that microwaving makes reguar bread rubbery but not so the low carb buns (same for their hot dog buns) while the usual warming makes them dry.

Opening the mouth wide and trying to put the pill waaay in the back of the mouth before clamping the jaws shut and massaging the throat until the poor dog swallows is a bad thing to do to a beloved pet.  It's bad because Pill Pockets make this chore a happy and delicious time for the dog involved.

I came across this while searching Amazon, so glad I gave it a try!.. \"\"try it\"\" I do not think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />I have added the chopped up chicken as suggested but i also added small chopped onion, it is unbelievable! Another great way to make it even better is try adding fresh Mango while it is simmering or if you cant find it fresh, use canned mango nectar, substitute 1/4 cup of the water for the mango juice. Super Good!. Also instead of 2 1/2 cups water as suggested  use only 2 1/4 cups water, brings out the flavor a little bit more I think (2 cups water / 1/4 cup mango nectar).\",5,positive,positive,0.8611612\r\n",

The tins are recyclable in most locations.  The individually wrapped candies are made with cane sugar and real ginger, no high fructose corn syrup so they are in a way better for you than other candy options.  Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and can settle a stomach and ease hearburn.  When's the last time your chocolate bar did that?\",4,positive,negative,0.8807133\r\n",

Most meals like this taste more like an upgraded cup of noodles, where this is a nice meal in a crunch. Now I will say you really need to read the instructions before cooking. The opening instructions can be assumed and cause the sauce to go flying when the food is done cooking. With that in mind, it's not ideal for kids to cook on their own. The film was rather tight and I can see a child or pre-teen getting burned if they are not paying attention while the open the contents. With that, please be careful.

I usually add a little more milk than instructed to cut down on the spice and add a little more creaminess.  The thing I really like about this chai mix is that it's not sweet at all.

       "B0076YVPFC,Handy,\"Love the idea of ready in a minute pasta and for that alone this product gets praise.  The pasta is whole grain so that's a big plus and it actually comes out al dente.  The vegetable marinara sauce is tasty, but has a high salt content - 710mg for a 9 oz. serving.<br /><br />It looks like much thought and testing went into creating the packaging, but I found it challenging.  You need to pull back the film to expose the sauce tray -- and not spill it.  I had to pull hard on the film, which made the sauce cup wiggle.  Easy to work around, but tricky nonetheless.<br /><br />All in all a step up from usual microwave in a minute fare.\",3,negative,positive,0.88317287\r\n",

The cereal, like I remember it, is very good and my boyfriend agrees that it is the best cereal he has ever had, but sadly after 5 months of searching I wont be ordering this cereal again.

Instead, I now buy Purina Chewnola bones - they entertain my little guy for hours and he keeps going back to it until it's gone.  I recommend this to anyone with a dog who's into chewing.  I also recommend you buy them on Amazon since you can pay as much as 50% less than you pay at a store.

I think they are a bit sweeter than regular Cadbury milk chocolate bars(but those are already pretty sweet too, so am not sure), and even though I like the texture, it's not worth it to pay so much for them.
