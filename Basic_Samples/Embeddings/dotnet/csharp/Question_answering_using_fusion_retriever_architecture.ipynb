    "5. It enters a loop that iterates over the `generatedQueriesEmbeddings`. For each embedding, it scores the knowledge base by similarity to the embedding, filters out items with a score less than 0.8, takes the top 10 items, and adds them to the `retrievedFacts` list.\n",

    "6. It scores the `retrievedFacts` by similarity to the `queryEmbedding`, filters out items with a score less than 0.8, takes the top `resultCount` items, and transforms them into `SearchResult` objects. This part is usually referred to as re-ranking.\n",
