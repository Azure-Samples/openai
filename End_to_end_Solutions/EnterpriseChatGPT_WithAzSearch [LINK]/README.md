# Revolutionize your Enterprise Data with ChatGPT: Next-gen Apps w/ Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search
It took less than a week for OpenAI’s ChatGPT to reach a million users, and it crossed the 100 million user mark in under two months. The interest and excitement around this technology has been remarkable. Users around the world are seeing potential for applying these large language models to a broad range of scenarios.

In the context of enterprise applications, the question we hear most often is “how do I build something like ChatGPT that uses my own data as the basis for its responses?”

The combination of [Azure Cognitive Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/search/) and [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/) yields an effective solution for this scenario.
