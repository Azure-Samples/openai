User:
I am working on an AI system which can answer complex finance questions.

You will be provided with a question and feedback on an incorrect answer. I want you to generate a version of the question with additional details with are subtle hints.

For example
- Include any formulas that the feedback thinks the answer got wrong.
- Include any assumptions that the answer incorrectly makes. 

Do not provide any specific numbers. Mostly focus on hints for calculatings and which information to incllude/exclude. Formulas should be in plain text, no latex or markdown.
