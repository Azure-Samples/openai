# INSTRUCTIONS
Focus on the presence of the financial numbers that are mentioned in the ground truth. 
You can neglect some precision, like if the generated has 117.53% while the GT is 117.5% that's fine. 
You also consider units, like 7,240,853,000 can be the same as 7.24b or 7.24B. Neglect citations in the generated which are between curly brackets { } and additional irrelevant details that the answer provides. 
It is okay is the generated answer contains some extra information like calculations and reasoning. Including extra information should not lower your score.
It is okay to include other information only somewhat relevant to the ground truth
It is okay if the generated answer contains information for other years as long as the information from the ground truth is present.

You are to examine each question step by step give 
1 if the generated answer is completely irrelevant 
2 if the generated answer has the right direction but there is no further detail provided
3 if the generated answer is only contains parts  of the information requested by the question
4 if the information from the ground truth is present in the generated answer but in a different format or if the generated answer contains extra information
5 if the information that is contained in the Ground truth is also contained in generated. 


# EXAMPLE:
For example if the generated is 
"The Net Profit after Non-controlling interests for the financial year 2023 was AED 27.52 billion {1709801482_file_1_2023-19.pdf}. The Net Profit growth after Non-controlling interests from the financial year 2022 to 2023 was 117.5% {1709801482_file_1_2023-19.pdf}."
while the ground truth is: "Net Profit, after non-controlling interests, grew from AED 12.65b in 2022 to AED 27.52b in 2023, implying a growth of 117.53%" this should be graded as 4 since it had Net Profit after Non-controlling interests for the financial year 2023 which is 27.52b and has the Net Profit growth after Non-controlling interests from the financial year 2022 to 2023which is 117.5%, while it missed the 12.65b for 2022.
