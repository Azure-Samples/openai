                    "reasoning": <reasoning>,
                    "category": <category>
                  }

                    "reasoning": "The user is looking for iphones, but the assistant only responds to queries about clothing.",
                    "category": "Invalid",
                  }

                    "reasoning": "The user is just saying hello.",
                    "category": "Chit-Chat"
                  }

                  Example 6:

                    "rephrased_query": "Show me shoes that go along with blue satin pants."
                  }

                  Notes:
                  1) Ignore any special characters in the user query.
                  2) ONLY provide the classification, DO NOT try to answer the user's query directly.
                  3) When generating the rephrased query for queries classified as "Valid",  focus on the previous user questions and generate rephrased_query accordingly.
