| **Discussion**         | - Customer: The approval page is taking over 10 seconds to load. It’s slowing down  |
|                        |   our workflow significantly.                                                       |
|                        | - Support Lead: We’ve logged multiple tickets on this in the past week. Seems to    |
|                        |   be affecting users across all regions.                                            |
|                        | - Developer: Initial profiling shows that the page is pulling too many records and  |
|                        |   attachments at once. The data fetch isn’t paginated.                              |
|                        | - UX Designer: From a design standpoint, we can introduce lazy loading or           |
|                        |   pagination. Also reduce default visible content.                                  |
|                        | - Product Manager: This delay is unacceptable for a critical workflow page. We      |
|                        |   need both a short-term fix and a long-term improvement.                           |
|                        | - Developer: I’ll implement pagination and defer loading of attachments. That       |
|                        |   should bring load time under 3 seconds.                                           |
|                        | - SRE: We’ve also noticed backend latency spikes during high traffic windows.       |
|                        |   Increasing DB connection pool may help temporarily.                               |
|                        | - QA: Please ensure we cover edge cases during testing, especially for approval     |
|                        |   bulk actions and filters.                                                         |
|                        | - Customer: Please share an ETA. This is impacting SLAs.                            |
|                        | - Engineering Manager: Hotfix will be deployed by tomorrow EOD. A full redesign     |
|                        |   for performance will be included in the next sprint cycle.                        |
