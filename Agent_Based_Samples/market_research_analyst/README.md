## üöÄ Overview

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:**
> Market Research Analyst is intended to be used **only with publicly available data. Do not use with any confidential or sensitive data.**

The‚ÄØ**Market Research Analyst**‚ÄØcode sample helps in building Agentic solutions designed to deliver timely, relevant, and structured product intelligence. It helps you combine intelligent automation and contextual reasoning to generate high-quality, persona-aligned research outputs for your agents.

At the core of this solution are four key capabilities:

- **üîç Search Query Generation**:
  Automatically creates precise, persona-aware, and context-rich search queries that align with the user‚Äôs research goals and desired report depth.

- **üì° Intelligent Research Execution**:
  Conducts targeted searches, filters credible sources, and extracts relevant trends, competitive shifts, and key updates from Bing.

- **üìù Automated Report Generation**:
  Transforms structured insights into clear, well-formatted intelligence reports tailored to the user's persona and the desired depth of information.

- **üìä Comparative Analysis**:
  Identifies progress or changes by comparing new research data against previously generated reports‚Äîhighlighting what's new, what's shifted, and what remains constant.

Together, these capabilities streamline research workflows and elevate insight accuracy - empowering users to make better-informed, faster decisions.

## üöß Key Challenges

- Surface only high-quality and relevant insights
- Generate both concise and comprehensive summaries
- Store and compare historical reports to track strategic shifts
- Align reporting with diverse personas and decision levels
- Highlight progress or lack of change across time

## üíº Use Cases

- Tracking product and platform evolution with time
- Creating focused intelligence reports for leadership
- Generating intelligent comparison reports highlighting latest updates against past benchmarks
- Monitoring feature adoption or innovation trends across products

## üß† Solution Architecture

The architecture is built on a modular and secure AI-native design leveraging:

- **Azure AI Foundry service** for agents in cloud and supporting tools (Grounding with Bing Search).
- **Semantic Kernel** for agent orchestration, agent memory and tools integration.
- **Azure AI Search** for storing reports and finding best report matches for user query.
- **Azure Key Vault** for secure secret management.
