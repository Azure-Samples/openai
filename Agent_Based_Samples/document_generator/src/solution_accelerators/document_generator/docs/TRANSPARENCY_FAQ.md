# Document Generation (DocGen) Solution Accelerator: Responsible AI FAQ 

## What is DocGen Solution Accelerator? 

The Document Generation Solution Accelerator is a powerful AI-powered solution designed to enhance GitHub Copilot's context by integrating intelligent agents and tools directly into VS Code using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It bridges the gap between GitHub Copilot and your organization's knowledge ecosystem, providing real-time access to enterprise data sources including SharePoint Sites, Azure DevOps (ADO) Boards, Azure AI Foundry Resources, and Microsoft Learn Documentation. 

## What can the DocGen Solution Accelerator do? 

The DocGen Solution Accelerator empowers organizations to automatically generate high-quality, context-rich documents by leveraging data and insights from across the enterprise. By integrating with systems like SharePoint, Azure DevOps, Azure AI Foundry, and Microsoft Learn Docs, it provides Copilot with a comprehensive view of project information and knowledge assets. 

This enhanced context enables Copilot to: 

- **Strategy Document Generation**: Generate comprehensive strategy documents grounded in real project data from SharePoint sites, combining historical insights with current project requirements 
- **Intelligent Project Planning**: Design and optimize project development plans using synthesized insights from code repositories, documentation, and Azure DevOps work items 
- **Component Reusability & Discovery**: Identify reusable components, patterns, and solutions across similar projects to accelerate delivery and reduce duplication 
- **Enterprise Knowledge Synthesis**: Transform static documentation into interactive, quarriable resources that deliver context-rich suggestions 
 
## What is DocGen Solution Accelerator intended use(s)? 

The solution accelerator is designed for multiple user personas and use cases: 

### Target Users: 
- **Developers**: Enhanced context for documentation with enterprise knowledge 
- **Program Managers**: Data-driven strategic planning and project management 
- **Business Users**: Access to synthesized organizational knowledge 

### Primary Use Cases: 
- **Enhanced Context-Rich Document Generation**: Synthesize insights from across enterprise ecosystem for intelligent decision making 
- **Accelerated Project Delivery**: Identify and reuse components across similar projects 
- **Streamlined Planning**: Create optimized development plans using insights from repositories and project management systems 
- **Rapid Onboarding & Training**: Generate personalized onboarding guides and dynamic workshop agendas 

## How was Doc Gen Solution Accelerator evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? 

We evaluated this solution using Azure AI Foundry Evaluation, focusing on the metric of "relevance" to measure performance. This metric assesses whether the content generated by our solution directly addresses the user's query and fully meets their requirements. High relevance indicates that all components of the solution are functioning as intended and delivering value to the user. 

## What are the limitations of Doc Gen Solution Accelerator? How can users minimize the impact of Doc Gen Solution Accelerator's limitations when using the system? 

- **Authentication Dependencies**: Requires proper configuration of Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for Azure DevOps—with the suggested permission set to "Work Item Read Only"—and the necessary permissions to access SharePoint resources. 
- **Model Dependencies**: Recommend to use specific models like gpt-4.1-mini for optimal SharePoint integration 
- Users should follow instructions provided through SETUP markdown file to setup all components and start MCP servers in their VS Code. They need to provide URL to their own organization SharePoint Site. 
- AI generated content may be inaccurate and should be manually reviewed.
