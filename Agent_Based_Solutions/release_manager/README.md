## 🚀 Overview

In modern software development, **Release Managers** play a pivotal role bridging the gap between development and operations. As the orchestrators of software deployment, they ensure that releases are timely, efficient, and risk-mitigated. However, increasing complexity and fragmentation across systems have made this role more challenging than ever.

The **Release Manager Assistant (RMA)** is a solution accelerator designed to augment release managers with AI-driven intelligence, multi-system integration, and real-time decision support. It simplifies the release lifecycle from planning to post-deployment analysis, all through a unified and contextual interface.

---

## 🧩 Key Challenges

- Fragmented release data across platforms
- Lack of real-time release health visibility
- High manual effort in compiling readiness reports
- Difficulty managing cross-team/service dependencies
- Visualizing complex data across multiple systems
- Notifying stakeholders on change in the system

---

## ✅ What the RMA Solves

### 🔄 Release Planning & Coordination

- Real-time dependency mapping and release health assessment
- Visualization of complex data

### 🕓 Scheduling & Readiness Automation

- Smart notifications
- Issue and stakeholder updates via integrated channels (emails)

### 🌐 Cross-System Collaboration

- Seamless integration with tools like:
  - JIRA
  - DevOps (MySQL database and/or API integration)
  - Microsoft Graph APIs
- Unified, contextual insights from disparate systems

---

## 🧠 Solution Architecture

The architecture is built on a modular and secure AI-native design leveraging:

- **Azure AI Foundry service** for agents in cloud and supporting tools (Code Interpreter).
- **Semantic Kernel** for agent orchestration, agent memory and tools integration.
- **Microsoft Graph API** for enterprise identity and email notification integration*.
- **Azure Key Vault & Azure Storage** for secure secret and data management.

*For setting up email notifications, additional setup is required. For instructions, please refer to this guide: [Microsoft Email Notifications Setup](src/solution_accelerators/release_manager/plugins/NOTIFICATIONS.md)*
